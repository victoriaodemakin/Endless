== Description ==

**All in One Product Quantity for WooCommerce** plugin lets you take a full control of product order quantities in WooCommerce.

Whether you want to set a minimum quantity for all products in your WooCommerce store, a maximum one, or a quantity step so customers can only buy in multiplications of your defined step, you can accomplish that with this plugin.

And to make it even better, the plugin now has a **Default Quantity** section which will allow you to show a default quantity for your products when customers open the product page, or even on archives/categories pages.

Product Quantity for WooCommerce plugin is a full set of features grouped in just one location for your ease, it will give you a full control over your WooCommerce products quantities so you can set up orders the way your store works.

More to what is mentioned above, you can also define decimal values for products in your store, show total price based on quantity in the product page (before the cart), show a dropdown menu for quantities, and more.

= Main Features =

* Set **minimum** products order quantities (**cart total** minimum quantity or **per item** minimum quantity).
* Set **maximum** products order quantities (**cart total** maximum quantity or **per item** maximum quantity).
* Set product **quantity step** (**cart total** quantity step or **per item** quantity step).
* Set product **default** quantity for all your store products.
* Enable **decimal quantities** in WooCommerce.
* Replace standard WooCommerce quantity number input with **dropdown**.
* Set **exact (i.e. fixed) allowed or disallowed quantities** (as comma separated list).
* Show total price for the quantity in 5 locations: Before / instead / after the price, before / after add to cart
* Define a unit to show next to price (i.e. $10 per KG)
* Show quantity field on archive / categories pages so customers can add to cart directly the desired quantity

= More Features =

* **Customize messages** your customer sees.
* Enable/disable **cart notices**.
* Enable/disable **add to cart quantity validation and correction**.
* Optionally stop customer from **reaching the checkout page** on wrong quantities.
* Add product **quantity info** on single product and/or archive pages.
* **Price display by quantity** in real-time.
* **Force initial quantity on single product and/or archive pages** to either min or max quantity.
* Set quantity **input style**.
* Hide **"Update cart"** button.

= Premium Version: Do More =

The plugin [Pro version](https://wpfactory.com/item/product-quantity-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=desc&utm_campaign=freeversion) allows you to set minimum quantity, maximum quantity, quantity step, default quantity, and exact (fixed) allowed & disallowed quantities options on **Per Product Basis** (i.e. different for each product).

So for example, Product A can have a minimum quantity of 5, maximum of 100, and step of 5, while product B can have no minimum quantity, maximum of 51 and step of 10 (Why 51? Simply because it has minimum of 1, then based on step 10, allowed quantities will be 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, and 51, but of course you can just leave it at 50, then the real maximum will be 41).

The Pro version also allows setting all these values on category level, so you can save yourself hours of input by just specifying the needed value on category base.
